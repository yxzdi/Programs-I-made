    The only way to lose weight is being in a caloric deficit. This means that you eat less calories than your body needs. As a result your body burns fat to get energy.So, what you need to do is
    download 'MyFitnessPal' app and track your calories. Even if you eat junk foods. You need to eat 100-200 calories less than your recommended daily intake.

<p>
    You also need to download "30 Days Weightloss Workout" app and excercise consistantly. This will help you burn calories and build muscle. A mistake that I did when working out was not completing the set, basically taking rest
    between reps which meant I didn't make my muscle tissues sore enough so that muscle growth could happen in its full potential. You need to finish the set or do it until your muscle tissues
    are sore before taking break.

<h3>And some tips to help you out <3</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Drink a glass of water 15 minutes before you eat which will make you eat less as you will feel full.</li>
    <li>Don't be too hard on yourself. You can occasionally give yourself a treat. Remember weight loss is not a short process so this process needs to be sustainable for you</li>
